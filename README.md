# College-Basketball-Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I am taking a dataset that contains 24,029 records of Colleges/Universities and their basketball team performance. The purpose of the project is to find which 5 teams had the best winrate and which 5 teams had the worst winrate. The data contains the name of the school, the conference, the wins and losses, the season, the coaches, the year, and much more. The project contains the following steps: setting a path for the dataset, converting columns into numeric types for division, calculating winrate, preventing division error with conditionals, applying a winrate column to the dataset, cleaning out NaN values and generating a new dataframe, and analyzing the data.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, python coding, debugging.

**Programming Languages/Tools:** Python, Pandas, google colab/jupyter notebook.

**Result:** Created a new dataframe that contains 5 colleges with the best winrate and 5 colleges with the worst winrate, which allowed for proper data analysis of which schools performed well and which schools didn't. In the dataframe, it contains the school, the coach, the season, and the winrate.
